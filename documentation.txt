This command does two things:

This will keep your database schema in sync with your Prisma schema.

#Error while migration
Error: Column count of mysql.proc is wrong. Expected 21, found 20. 
Created with MariaDB 100108, now running 100421. Please use mysql_upgrade to fix this error Prisma

Solution :- 
I also could not run the code from the Terminal. I was, however, able to go to the folder itself and "run" the mysql_upgrade application. 
If you are using XAMPP and the Application Manager, there's a button to Open Application Folder. 
If you click that, finder will open where XAMPP lives. Open the bin folder. Then scroll until you find mysql_upgrade. 
Double click it. It will run in a Terminal session and complete the upgrade. 
Hope this helps someone else as I spent waaayyyy too much time trying to get this to work.
